1. Make sure checks pass: types:generate
2. Come up with a commit message
3. Commit all of your changes with Cursor as a co-author using this format:

   ```
   git commit -m "type: message

   Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursor@cursor.bot>"
   ```

4. Push them to the remote

Note: Keep in mind that there might be parallel agents working on the same worktree, so be mindful and only commit your changes.
